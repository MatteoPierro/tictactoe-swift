# Tic Tac Toe

## Rules

- X always goes first.

- Players cannot play on a played position.

- Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on the board until either:

	- One player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally

	- All nine squares are filled.

- If a player is able to draw three X’s or three O’s in a row, that player wins.

- If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
